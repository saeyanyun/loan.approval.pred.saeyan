# Loan Approval Prediction

Machine learning project for predicting loan approval outcomes using ensemble models and deep neural networks.

##👥 Collaborators
**Ryan Bausback & Yuhui Wang**

## 📊 Overview
This project explores multiple machine learning approaches to predict whether a loan application will be approved, based on applicant and loan features.  
Both tree-based ensemble methods and deep learning models were optimized using **Optuna** for hyperparameter tuning.

## 🧠 Models and Methods
- **Algorithms:** XGBoost, LightGBM, CATBoost, PyTorch Neural Networks  
- **Optimization:** Optuna for Bayesian hyperparameter tuning  
- **Evaluation Metric:** ROC-AUC (achieved 0.96)  
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-learn, PyTorch
